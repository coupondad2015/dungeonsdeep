Theme Song: 
Written July, 1985 by Casper McElwee, Lyrics adapted.
"Dungeons deep and caverns old…"
"Enter now if ye be bold."

A tattered tome read..
No record agrees on when the passages were first cut.
Stone bears marks of tools and peoples no longer named.
The air below does not move as it should.
Light shortens. Sound lingers.
Some walls are smooth from hands.
Others from time.
There are places where footsteps cease to echo, though the corridor continues.
There are stairs worn thin by descent.
Those who carried flame wrote little.
At the twentieth descent, the stone changes.
Whether this is an ending—or merely a threshold—remains unclear.

Good luck adventurer!
